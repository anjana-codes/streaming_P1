# streaming_P1
Initial Streaming Project using the provided producer and consumer scripts

The goal is to:
Understand Python generators.
Modify producers and consumers for real-time data streaming.
Perform basic real-time analytics.

This project introduces streaming data. 
The Python language includes generators - we'll use this feature to generate some streaming buzzline messages. 
As the code runs, it will continuously update the log file. 
We'll use a consumer to monitor the log file and alert us when a special message is detected. 

## Task 1: Create a Unique Producer
Add a new Python script in the producers folder.
Name your script using your unique identifier (e.g., basic_producer_yourname.py).
Copy and paste the content from the example file into  yours. 
Git add, commit, and push your changes to your GitHub repo before making any other changes. See instructions at https://github.com/denisecase/buzzline-01-case/blob/main/docs/GIT-ADD-COMMIT-PUSH.mdLinks to an external site..
Modify your Python generator to produce custom messages.
Log these messages using the provided logger.
As you work, git add, commit, and push your changes to your GitHub repo. (Frequent small, commits are helpful.)
