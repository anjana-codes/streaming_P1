# PRoject: streaming_P1
Initial Streaming Project using the provided producer and consumer scripts.
The goal is to:

Understand Python generators.
Modify producers and consumers for real-time data streaming.
Perform basic real-time analytics.

This project introduces streaming data. 
The Python language includes generators - we'll use this feature to generate some streaming buzzline messages. 
As the code runs, it will continuously update the log file. 
We'll use a consumer to monitor the log file and alert us when a special message is detected. 

## Steps for Project Initialization

1. Create-repo-in-github.
2. Use git to clone the new repository to your local machine.
3. Clone-repo-to-local machine.
4. Add key files such as .gitignore and requirements.txt.
5. Use Git to add, commit, and push your new files to GitHub.
6. ALWAYS Create a Python Virtual Environment for your project.
7. Install dependencies.
  

### Task 1: Create a Unique Producer
1. Add a new Python script in the producers folder.
2. Name your script using your unique identifier (basic_producer_anjana.py).
3. Copy and paste the content from the example file into yours. 
4. Git add, commit, and push your changes to your GitHub repo before making any other changes. 
     See instructions at https://github.com/denisecase/buzzline-01-case/blob/main/docs/GIT-ADD-COMMIT-PUSH.mdLinks to an external site.
5. Modify your Python generator to produce custom messages.
6. Log these messages using the provided logger.
7. As you work, git add, commit, and push your changes to your GitHub repo. (Frequent small, commits are helpful.)

## Task 2: Create a Unique Consumer
1. Add a new Python script in the consumers folder.
2. Name your script uniquely (basic_consumer_anjana.py).
3. Copy and paste the content from the example file into  yours. 
4. Git add, commit, and push your changes to your GitHub repo before making any other changes. 
5. Continue to read the log file in real time as we did in the example. 
6. Implement real-time analytics (e.g., alerting on a specific pattern that matches your new messages).
7. As you work, git add, commit, and push your changes to your GitHub repo.
